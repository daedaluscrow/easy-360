# easy-360
A template for creating easy 360 image and video tours in Babylon.js with little to no coding knowledge. 

# Instructions

Start by viewing [this tutorial video](https://video.vt.edu/media/easy-360-tutorial/1_jffzf897) first. It provides a more in-depth explanation of how to use this template.

Click the download button on the top right-hand corner of this page, at which point you will download a zip file, which you can unzip onto your computer somewhere.

Inside the folder structure you'll find a folder called "Assets," which is where you should place all of your 360 image and video files and any audio (like narration) you want to use in the experience.

After putting all of your files in the assets folder, open the file called "config.json." Check the example in the file to see the structure. Here you will input, in order, the names of the files you want to use in the experience, any text you want to appear in the world, and any audio you want to accompany it.

After that, you should be able to double click on "index.html" to have the experience open in the browser. This is a way for you to test your experience and make sure everything looks and behaves as you expect.

If you want to put this on a website somewhere, just upload the entire folder to a server that you have access. VT provides some server space for faculty and students to use for such projects.
